This repository will be periodically updated with subsequent work.


# What's in this repository?

The folder "Bachelor's_Thesis" contains the final text of the Bachelor's Thesis of Sergio Turrado: "Isometry Groups in the Friedmann-Lemaa√Ætre-Robertson-Walker Cosmological Models",
within the Double Degree in Physics and Mathematics program at Universidad de Granada (Spain). This 360 ECTS program leads to the obtention of two separate Bachelor titles,
one in Physics, and one in Mathematics, although only one joined Thesis is required.


The folder "Master's_Thesis" contains the text of Sergio Turrado's Master's Thesis: "Numerical modeling of the atmosphere of exoplanet Trappist-1e", within the Master's Degree 
in Astrophysics (60 ECTS) at Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain). An additional folder "Master's_Thesis_All_Figures" is also resent, which contains the complete output
of the numerical model used for the Thesis, which is too lengthy to be included in the final text of the Thesis.
