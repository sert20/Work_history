# What's in this folder?
This folder contains Sergio Turrado's Master's Thesis "Numerical modeling of the atmosphere of exoplanet Trappist-1e",
within the Master's Degree in Astrophysics (60 ECTS) at Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain).

The file "Master's_Thesis_ES.pdf" is the complete text of the Thesis in its original version in Spanish.
A version translated to English will be available soon.

The folder "Master's_Thesis_All_Figures" contains the complete postprocessed ROCKE-3D output of the simulated cases in the Thesis.
It is intended to serve as support material to the Thesis, to facilitate reading and providing the reader with complete information about each simulated case.
In particular, those cases named with the label "900_Wm-2" are the ones intended to reproduce the THAI collaboration results,
while the ones labelled "881_Wm-2" are meant to compare the effects of a lower instellation on the global climate.
